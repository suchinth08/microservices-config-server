IBM India Private Limited is the Indian subsidiary of IBM.
It
has facilities in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneshwar, Chennai,
Coimbatore, Delhi, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kochi, Kolkata,
Mumbai, Noida, Pune, Mysore and Visakhapatnam.
Between 2003 and 2007, IBM's head count in India has grown by
almost 800%, from 9,000 in 2003[4]
to nearly 74,000 in 2007.
Since 2006, IBM has been the multinational with the largest
number of employees in India.
IBM is very secretive about the
geographic distribution of its employees. By most estimates, it has
close to a third of its 288,000 employees (~ 100,000) in India, and
it likely has more employees there than in the US.
IBM, in an analyst meeting held at Bangalore on 6 June 2005
stated that IBM's India plans are for the long term & committed to
invest $6 billion in the next three years in India, triple the amount
invested in the three years preceding the meeting.[6]
IBM worldwide expects its revenues to be around $120 billion by
2010, of which nearly $86 billion (68%) would come from IBM
Consulting alone, with an estimate of about 80,000 employees.
IBM India would account for 90,000 of these. Roughly translated,
IBM's Indian employees would generate $35 billion of IBM's
revenues in 2010.
IBM Global Services (now split to Business Services & Technical
Services) was called the "jewel in the IBM crown" by the
Aberdeen group in 2003. For worldwide IBM, this is the group
that contributes to more than half its global revenues ($54 billion in
2005) presently and growing at a healthy rate (8% in 2005). With
half of global service employees to be located in India, IBM India's
importance for the global corporation can be easily fathomed.
In 2005., Ginni Rometty at the Enterprise Business Services unit of
IBM worldwide and heralded changes that would have long
running implications and would lead to the explosive growth of
IBM in India. To emphasize how serious IBM was about making
India a major IBM headcount and business growth destination, a Global Briefing event for investors and
analysts was held in Bangalore in June 2006 with India's then President Abdul Kalam as the Chief Guest.
Most of the senior most IBM executives were present for the event. To bring more focus to growing the

technical talent in India, IBM appointed IBM Fellow C. Mohan of
IBM Research in Silicon Valley as the IBM India Chief Scientist, a
new position that was created for that purpose. Mohan served in
that position from June 2006 to January 2009 in Bangalore and
then returned to IBM Research – Almaden.
At an investor meet in 2006, she identified five areas that would
transform IBM and bring 'profitable growth'. In order of
importance, they were Business Transformation Outsourcing,
Application Management Services, Business Solutions, Small &
Medium Business & Innovation. In each one of these areas, IBM
India figures prominently and employee numbers have grown
multi-fold in the last two years.
IBM India's domestic revenues grew at 60% in 2005-06 making it
one of the highest growth areas in the entire IBM portfolio of geographies & businesses. IBM India is also
the biggest domestic IT player in the country, replacing HCL Technologies. It's worthwhile to mention that
Airtel, India's largest private telecom company which had chosen IBM as its strategic partner for
outsourcing its entire network & IT backbone – a deal worth about $750 million initially, has decided to
renew it for another five years, reducing the order by more than half the size of the one that expired at the
end of March 2014.[9]
In making the change to its new mode of operation, a number of restructuring steps
were taken: - All installed equipment (equipment in India was all leased by the month
– a GOI requirement) was 'sold' to the existing users for a nominal amount of less than
$10 - The (profitable) Service Bureaus were given to the employees who were
employed in them at that time. A management structure was established, based upon
several of the most senior Indian managers, who collectively became the majority
shareholders in the new company, which they named IDM (International Data
Management) - The equipment service business was transferred as a single total entity
to the GOI, on the understanding that they would continue to offer maintenance
service to all existing users. IBM undertook to provide spare parts for installed
equipment for at least a further 5 years - Employees who were working in other
countries at that time were offered positions in those countries, if the immigration laws
allowed. Most accepted and a number went on to achieve promotions to senior positions in those countries
and around the world - The employment of all other employees was terminated, with what were generally
considered to be generous redundancy terms.
History
Pre-liberalization story
Post-liberalization story
The Indian economy was liberalized in 1991, relaxing FDI norms. IBM re-entered India in 1987 with a
Tata joint-venture, named Tata Information Systems Ltd. Its business interest in India was still focused on
product sales.
IBM India has now grown to an extent where it poses a stiff challenge to homegrown Software companies
of India in IT global delivery and manpower attraction/retention. It now operates the following business
lines from India which contributes to worldwide IBM in a global delivery framework: India Software Labs
(ISL), India Research Lab (IRL), Linux Technology Center, Global Business Services(GBS), Global
Technology Services (GTS) formerly known as ITD-GD (Information Technology Delivery – Global
Delivery), Global Business Solutions Center (GBSC), Sales & Distribution (S&D), Integrated Technology
Services (ITS).
On 2 March 2012 it was reported that IBM India wants to open sales office in around 40 Tier-I and Tier-II
cities of India in year 2012–2013.[10]
The head of IBM India is called a country manager. These people have headed IBM India during its history
in the country.
